## Introduction
In this project, we leverage historical sales data to predict future sales, offering valuable insights for optimizing inventory management and sales forecasting in the retail store.

## Dataset
The dataset used is sourced from the "Predict Future Sales" competition on Kaggle. Download it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/data). The dataset comprises several CSV files providing information about items, shops, item categories, historical sales, and the test set for making predictions.

## Data Cleaning

The data cleaning process involves removing outliers, handling missing values, and correcting inconsistencies. Techniques such as boxplot analysis, outlier removal, and label encoding are applied to ensure the data is suitable for analysis and modeling.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is a crucial step in building predictive models. In this project, we create new features, including lagged values of the target variable and average item counts for various combinations of time, shop, and item, providing valuable historical information for prediction.

## Model Training

After feature engineering, we train a machine learning model to predict future sales. The specific model used can be customized based on project requirements. Commonly used models for time series forecasting include linear regression, random forest, and gradient boosting algorithms.

## Usage
To run the code and reproduce the results:

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lohitkolluri/Sales_Predictor.git
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Ensure dataset files are in the correct directory.**
   
4. **Run the `Sales_Predictor.ipynb` notebook:**
   Execute the code to generate predictions.

5. **Output:**
   The output will be stored in a file or displayed on the console, depending on the implementation.
